# Hotel_MIDLAND_Management_System

This Project mainly deals with database written in C++. Here I have used a file handling concept of C++ to store data in a file.
We can run this project in any C/C++ compiler.

In this Hotel Management System, a customer can book the room on the basis of availability of the rooms.
There are mainly 3 types of room a person can book:
1. Single-bed rooms
2. Double-bed rooms
3. Meeting rooms

Also anyone can search for a person's room he/she is staying in or details of the guests of the hotel.
Modification & Deletion of customer's record can be done. Bill will be made on the basis of category of rooms and no of days
a person stayed in the room.
